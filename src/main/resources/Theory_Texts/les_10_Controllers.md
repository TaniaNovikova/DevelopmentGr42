Introductory Lecture on the Topic: Controllers in Spring Boot
1. Introduction to Spring Boot and Controllers
   Spring Boot is a framework for building modern Java applications that significantly simplifies development through automatic configuration and built-in solutions for creating web applications, microservices, and REST APIs. One of the key concepts in Spring Boot is the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, where controllers play a central role.

A controller is a component that handles HTTP requests from the client (e.g., a browser or another service) and returns HTTP responses. In Spring Boot, controllers are implemented using annotations, making them easy to use and configure.

2. Key Responsibilities of a Controller
   Controllers in Spring Boot perform the following tasks:

Request Handling: Accept HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
Routing: Determine which controller method should handle the request based on the URL and HTTP method.
Interaction with Business Logic: Pass data from the request to the service layer for processing.
Response Formation: Return data to the client in JSON, XML, or HTML format.
3. Annotations for Creating Controllers
   Spring Boot provides a set of annotations for creating controllers:

@RestController:

Indicates that the class is a controller.
Combines the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations, meaning that all methods return data in JSON or XML format by default.
@RequestMapping:

Defines the base URL for all methods in the controller.
For example, @RequestMapping("/api") means that all methods will be accessible under the /api/... path.
@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping:

Specify which HTTP method the controller method handles.
For example, @GetMapping("/users") handles GET requests to /users.
@PathVariable:

Used to extract data from the URL.
For example, in the URL /users/{id}, {id} will be extracted and passed to the method as a parameter.
@RequestParam:

Used to extract query parameters from the URL.
For example, in the URL /users?name=John, the name parameter will be extracted.
@RequestBody:

Used to extract data from the request body (usually in JSON format).
4. Example of a Simple Controller
   Let's look at an example of a controller for managing a list of users:

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {

    private List<String> users = new ArrayList<>();

    // Get all users
    @GetMapping
    public List<String> getUsers() {
        return users;
    }

    // Get a user by ID
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getUserById(@PathVariable int id) {
        return users.get(id);
    }

    // Add a new user
    @PostMapping
    public String addUser(@RequestBody String user) {
        users.add(user);
        return "User added: " + user;
    }

    // Update a user by ID
    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public String updateUser(@PathVariable int id, @RequestBody String user) {
        users.set(id, user);
        return "User updated: " + user;
    }

    // Delete a user by ID
    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public String deleteUser(@PathVariable int id) {
        users.remove(id);
        return "User deleted";
    }
}
5. How Does a Controller Work?
   The client sends an HTTP request to the server (e.g., GET /users).
   Spring Boot analyzes the URL and HTTP method to determine which controller method should handle the request.
   The controller method executes the necessary logic (e.g., retrieves data from the database).
   The controller returns a response to the client (e.g., a list of users in JSON format).
6. Advantages of Using Controllers in Spring Boot
   Simplicity: Annotations make the code clear and concise.
   Flexibility: Supports various HTTP methods and data formats (JSON, XML, HTML).
   Integration: Easily integrates with other Spring components (services, repositories, databases).
   Scalability: Enables the creation of both small applications and complex microservices.
7. Practical Applications
   Controllers are used for:

Creating REST APIs for mobile and web applications.
Handling forms and user data.
Integrating with external systems via HTTP requests.
Building microservice architectures.
8. Conclusion
   Controllers are the heart of any Spring Boot application. They facilitate interaction between the client and server by handling requests and returning responses. The use of annotations makes developing controllers simple and efficient, allowing developers to focus on implementing business logic.
